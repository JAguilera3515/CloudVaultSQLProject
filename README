  The project we have chosen is the installation and deployment option. Where we will launch a Single-Sign-On LDAP server 
  that will suport a network file system. This file system will be some what like Amazon s2 cloud services but much more 
  less complex and more of a local thing insead of global. The network will have a Single-Sign-On LDAP, where LDAP will 
  store user and group information. Also, for SSO we will use a kubernetes infrastructure. Where we will launch either a linux
  or some form of virtual machine to the cloud. We will also require other services for SSO that we will be adding as we 
  progress through the development of the project. We are thinking of using something like Microsoft active directory as 
  our starting position or looking for other examples.
